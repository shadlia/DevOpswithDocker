## Changes Made

### Removed Port Exposure from Docker Compose

For this exercise, I removed the exposure of ports 8000 and 5000 from the `docker-compose.yml` file. Originally, the `docker-compose.yml` included explicit port mappings for the backend and frontend services:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: backend-exemple
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    ...
  frontend:
    image: frontend-exe
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    ...
```

This change was already made in the previous Exercise 2.9.
